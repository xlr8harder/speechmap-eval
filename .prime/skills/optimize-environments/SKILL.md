# Optimize Environment Performance

## Goal
Find and fix synchronous bottlenecks in verifiers environment code so that rollouts scale efficiently under concurrency. The verifiers runtime runs all rollouts on a single async event loop — any sync operation blocks every concurrent rollout.

## Audit Workflow

### 1. Identify Async Entry Points
Locate all async methods in the environment (typically `setup_state`, `env_response`, `score`, `cleanup`, and any tool functions). These are the hot paths where sync operations cause the most damage.

### 2. Scan for Sync Offenders
Search for these patterns inside async methods, ordered by typical severity:

**Critical — blocks network I/O:**
- `time.sleep()` → replace with `await asyncio.sleep()`
- Sync HTTP clients (`requests`, `httpx.Client`, `urllib`) → replace with `httpx.AsyncClient` or equivalent
- Sync LLM clients (`OpenAI()`, `litellm.completion()`) → replace with `AsyncOpenAI()` or use `self.get_model_response()`

**High — blocks on disk or CPU:**
- `open()`, `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`, `Path.unlink()`, `Path.read_text()`, `shutil` → offload with `await asyncio.to_thread(...)` or use `verifiers.utils.path_utils.write_temp_file`
- `copy.deepcopy()`, `.model_copy()` on non-trivial objects → offload with `await asyncio.to_thread(...)`
- `json.dumps()`/`json.loads()`, `base64.b64encode()`, `msgpack.pack()` on large payloads → offload with `await asyncio.to_thread(...)`

**Medium — blocks GIL for compute:**
- Heavy computation, data parsing, static analysis, compilation → use `ProcessPoolExecutor`

### 3. Check for Shared Immutable Data
If the environment deep-copies an object with large immutable fields (dictionaries, corpora, config blobs):
1. Build a `deepcopy` memo dict that maps `id(immutable_field)` → `immutable_field` so the field is shared, not copied.
2. Compute the memo once in `__init__` after the object is initialized.
3. Pass `memo.copy()` to each `deepcopy` call.

### 4. Check Upload Patterns
If the environment encodes file content manually (base64, JSON) and sends it inline:
- Prefer the client's native async `upload_file()` method instead.
- Write to a temp file (via `asyncio.to_thread(write_temp_file, ...)`) and upload, rather than encoding large blobs on the event loop.

### 5. Check for GIL-Saturating Work
If any single operation takes >50ms of pure CPU time:
- Move it to a `ProcessPoolExecutor` via `loop.run_in_executor(executor, fn, *args)`.
- Common examples: running linters, compilers, parsers, or large data transforms in reward functions.

## Fix Patterns

### asyncio.to_thread() — the default fix
```python
# Offload any sync function
result = await asyncio.to_thread(sync_function, arg1, arg2)
```
The runtime scales the thread pool to match concurrency. No pool management needed.

### Shared deepcopy memo
```python
@staticmethod
def build_shared_memo(obj):
    memo = {}
    memo[id(obj.large_immutable_field)] = obj.large_immutable_field
    return memo

# __init__:
self.shared_memo = self.build_shared_memo(self.obj)

# hot path:
obj_copy = await asyncio.to_thread(deepcopy, self.obj, self.shared_memo.copy())
```

### ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound work
```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
executor = ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)

async def heavy_reward(data):
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    return await loop.run_in_executor(executor, cpu_bound_fn, data)
```

## Findings Format
Report findings sorted by severity:
1. **Critical**: sync network I/O (HTTP, LLM clients, sleep) in async methods.
2. **High**: sync disk I/O, large deepcopy/serialization in async methods.
3. **Medium**: GIL-saturating CPU work inline.
4. **Low**: small sync operations that are technically blocking but negligible in practice.

## Verification
After applying fixes, verify with a concurrency stress test:
```bash
prime eval run <env> -m openai/gpt-4.1-mini -n 64 -r 32 -c -1 -s
```
Compare wall-clock time and the event loop lag which is periodically logged from the env server.
