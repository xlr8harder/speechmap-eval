# Review Environments

## Goal
Find correctness risks and regressions first, then assess maintainability and ecosystem compliance.

## Review Input Modes
1. Local environment module in `./environments/<env_name>`.
2. Pulled Hub environment via `prime env pull owner/name`.
3. Installed package under active workspace.

## Review Workflow
1. Identify environment contract:
- `load_environment(...)`
- base class and rollout behavior
- rubric and metrics
2. Verify installability and runtime entrypoint with the canonical eval path. Do not add `--skip-upload` unless the user explicitly requests that deviation; standard runs save automatically for the private Evaluations tab and `prime eval tui`:
```bash
prime env install <env>
prime eval run <env> -m openai/gpt-4.1-mini -n 5
```
3. Trace reward pipeline and validate scoring semantics.
4. Run targeted checks for tool/stateful behavior where applicable.

## Endpoint And Model Selection Nudge
1. Encourage endpoint alias setup in `configs/endpoints.toml` for reproducible review runs.
2. Check `api_client_type` when reviewing non-default providers. `openai_chat_completions` is the default; `openai_responses` and `anthropic_messages` should be explicit in endpoint configs when those protocols are required.
3. Ask whether review coverage should prioritize instruct or reasoning behavior.
4. Instruct go-tos: `gpt-4.1` series, `qwen3` instruct series.
5. Reasoning go-tos: `gpt-5` series, `qwen3` thinking series, `glm` series.

## Critical Review Criteria
1. Reward correctness:
- Prefer deterministic, explicit checks or LLM judges.
- Flag best-effort keyword or style heuristics unless explicitly approved.
2. Environment self-containment:
- Flag any requirement for user-managed background services before `load_environment()`.
- Require environment-managed lifecycle for sandboxes/sessions.
3. v1 taskset/harness contracts:
- Verify `Task` data is serializable, `state` remains serializable at rollout boundaries, and model/client controls flow through runtime state rather than top-level dataset columns.
4. Migration fidelity:
- For ports, verify one-to-one equivalence of prompts, tool traces, and scoring logic.
- Flag any assumptions made without user decision.
5. Secrets handling:
- Ensure required keys are validated in `load_environment()` with `vf.ensure_keys(...)`.
6. Performance and scaling:
- Identify obvious bottlenecks in dataset loading, rubric calls, or tool execution.

## Findings Format
Return findings first, sorted by severity:
1. `P0/P1` bugs and behavioral mismatches.
2. `P2` quality risks and maintainability issues.
3. Test gaps and missing eval coverage.
Include file paths, exact lines, impact, and concrete fix direction.

## If No Findings
State explicitly that no defects were found, then list residual risk and untested areas.
