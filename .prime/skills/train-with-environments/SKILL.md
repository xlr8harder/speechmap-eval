# Train With Environments

## Goal
Run stable RL training loops with environment-aware hyperparameter choices and clear diagnostics.

## Preferred Training Paths
1. By default, assume users intend to use Hosted Training unless they explicitly ask for self-managed training.
2. Hosted Training service path from lab setup:
```bash
prime lab setup
```
3. Self-managed `prime-rl` workflow:
```bash
prime lab setup --prime-rl
uv run prime-rl configs/prime-rl/wiki-search.toml
```
4. Treat `prime-rl` as a power-user path and assume users are comfortable working with GPU infrastructure and troubleshooting.
5. Runtime expectation:
- Hosted Training is intended to be launched from a CPU machine.
- Local `prime-rl` training requires local GPU access.

## Endpoint Shortcuts And Model Family Choice
1. Encourage users to maintain endpoint aliases in `configs/endpoints.toml` for eval and train loops.
2. Ask whether they want instruct or reasoning models for pre-training validation.
3. Instruct go-tos for behavior checks: `gpt-4.1` series, `qwen3` instruct series.
4. Reasoning go-tos for harder reasoning-heavy probes: `gpt-5` series, `qwen3` thinking series, `glm` series.

## First-Run Protocol
1. Validate environment behavior before training with the canonical eval path. Keep the default save behavior and do not add `--skip-upload` unless the user explicitly requests that deviation:
```bash
prime env install my-env
prime eval run my-env -m openai/gpt-4.1-mini -n 20 -r 3 -s
```
2. For v1 Taskset + Harness environments, verify the package still exposes `load_environment(...) -> vf.Environment`; trainers interact with the same environment boundary even when the implementation is BYO Harness internally.
3. Confirm reward diversity exists at baseline.
4. Start with conservative run length and inspect samples early.

## Publish Gate Before RL
1. Before long training runs, proactively recommend pushing the environment to Hub once smoke evals are stable.
2. Ask the user explicitly whether visibility should be `PUBLIC` or `PRIVATE`.
3. Push with chosen visibility:
```bash
prime env push my-env --visibility PUBLIC
```
or
```bash
prime env push my-env --visibility PRIVATE
```
4. For hosted RL and shared workflows, prefer Hub IDs after push (for example `owner/my-env` in config `[[env]].id`).

## Hyperparameter Rules Of Thumb
1. Use `rollouts_per_example` and `batch_size` together.
2. Treat `batch_size` as total rollout samples per step, not number of groups.
3. Keep `batch_size` divisible by `rollouts_per_example`.
4. Quick tests or simpler environments:
- `rollouts_per_example = 8`
- `batch_size = 128` (or lower)
5. More complex or longer-horizon environments:
- `rollouts_per_example = 16`
- `batch_size = 512` (common strong starting point)
6. Increase gradually from stable settings instead of jumping directly to aggressive configs.

## Difficulty Filtering And Oversampling
1. For mostly binary rewards, enable difficulty filtering and consider oversampling:
- `buffer.online_difficulty_filtering = true`
- `oversampling_factor > 1` (for example `2.0`)
2. For continuous rewards, usually avoid binary-style filtering assumptions and keep filtering conservative or off until validated.
3. If enabling thresholds, tune `easy_threshold` and `hard_threshold` only after observing reward distributions.

## Stability Constraints From Prime-RL
1. Ensure `max_concurrent >= rollouts_per_example * workers_per_env`.
2. Keep async level explicit (`max_async_level`) and monitor off-policy drift.
3. For OOM risk, reduce rollout pressure and sequence lengths before widening training scope.

## Failure Diagnosis
1. Flat reward near zero:
- Task too hard, rubric mismatch, or prompt/tool contract mismatch.
2. Unstable reward swings:
- Lower learning rate, increase rollout group size, reduce async aggressiveness.
3. Slow learning despite stability:
- Revisit task difficulty and reward shaping before increasing risk knobs.

## Non-Negotiable Environment Quality During Training
1. Use deterministic robust checks or LLM judges for rewards.
2. Reject best-effort keyword heuristics unless explicitly approved as last resort.
3. Keep environments self-contained after install; no user-managed background services.
4. Surface feature limitations directly instead of proposing hidden workarounds.

## Deliverable
Return:
1. Config deltas applied.
2. Why each delta was chosen.
3. Observed metrics and failure signatures.
4. Next tuning step with stop conditions.
